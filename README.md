# 🤖 AI-Assisted Playwright Test Automation

This project demonstrates an **AI-forward QA approach** where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to **generate Playwright test cases from requirements**, while keeping test execution fully deterministic.

AI here is an **assistant**, not a replacement for QA engineers.
